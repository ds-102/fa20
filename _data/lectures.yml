  topic: Course Overview, Making Decisions Under Uncertainty
  description: We provide an overview of data science and where it might head in the future.
    We discuss the importance of decision-making rather than simple inference. As a first step in this direction we
    cover the different angles through which a simple hypothesis test can be viewed.

  topic: Multiple Hypothesis Testing
  description: We continue investigating the different ways of understanding error in hypothesis testing.
    We introduce the Neyman-Pearson principle and Neyman-Pearson Lemma for controlling error in a single test, and
    also introduce the challenges involved in multiple hypothesis testing.

  topic: False Discovery Rate Control
  description: We consider the Bonferroni test, which is a naive way of controlling the family-wise error rate.
    We then look into Benjamini-Hochberg which is a more elaborate method that controls the false discovery rate.

  topic: Online False Discovery Rate Control
  slides: assets/lectures/lecture4.pdf
  description: We consider how to extend FDR control to the online setting, and introduce the LORD algorithm.
    We also begin to review the Bayesian and frequentist approahces to decision-making.
