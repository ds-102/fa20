    "# Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will be implementing two of the most common approaches to solving stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems. We first define the problem and then you will have a chance to implement the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and the Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm from lecture and analyze their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup: {-}\n",
    "A MAB problem is a simple setting in which it is easy to analyze the __exploration/exploitation__ tradeoff that is extremely common in machine learning. The setup is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A MAB instance is a set $\\mathcal{A}$ of $K$ arms. Each arm $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$ is associated with a reward distribution $X_a \\sim \\mathbb{P}_a$ which is unique to that arm. The mean of an arm $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$ is denoted as $\\mu_a=\\mathbb{E}[X_a]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each time $t=1,2,...$, an algorithm that is interacting with a MAB must choose an arm, $A_t \\in \\mathcal{A}$. The algorithm then receives a reward $X_{A_t}^{(t)}$ sampled independently from $\\mathbb{P}_{A_t}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __goal__ of an algorithm interacting with a MAB instance is to find the arm $A^\\ast$ with the highest mean reward $\\mu^\\ast$ as fast as possible while maintaining performance. That is, it would like to find the single optimal arm $A^\\ast$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A^\\ast=arg\\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\mu_a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu^*=\\mu_{A^\\ast}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often encoded as wanting to find an algorithm that minimizes the __regret__ over a time horizon $T$. Intuitively, the regret is the best the algorithm could have done in hindsight if it had known which was the optimal arm ($A^*$). The regret of an algorithm is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Regret(T)= \\sum_{t=1}^T X_{A^\\ast}^{(t)} -X_{A_t}^{(t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, it is simpler to analyze the __pseudo-regret__, which is the mean of the regret.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_T= T \\mu^* - \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=1}^T X_{A_t}^{(t)}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab setup: {-}\n",
    "In this lab, the MAB instances will have a set of arms numbered $0,1,...,K-1$. Each arm $a=0,1,...,K-1$ is associated with a Gaussian reward distribution with mean $\\mu_a$ and standard deviation of $\\sigma_a=1.5$. To be able to analyze the various algorithms, the optimal arm $A^\\ast$ will always be arm $0$, and its mean will always be $\\mu^\\ast=10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By running the following cells, you can interact with a MAB instance of the type we will be using in this lab. You can see the reward distributions as well as the expected cumulative regret you incur when pulling each arm. \n",
