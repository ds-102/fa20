    "In this lab we will combine ideas from Multi Armed Bandits (MAB) and Stable Matching (SB). In Question 1 you will design a matching algorithm for the case when the preferences of both sides are known. In Question 2 we will extend the approach to consider cases when the preferences of the players are not known and have to be learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is inspired by the paper: [Liu, Lydia T., Horia Mania, and Michael Jordan. \"Competing bandits in matching markets.\" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics. PMLR, 2020.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05363.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup: {-}\n",
    "We will consider the following Matching Markets setup. There are $n$ players and $n$ arms. Let $\\mu_{ij}$ be the average reward arm $i$ gives to user $j$. This means that each arm $i$ has a preference over users. The most preferred player for arm $i$ is $\\arg\\max_j(\\mu_{ij})$ while the least preferred player $\\arg\\min_j(\\mu_{ij})$. Similarly each user $j$ has a preference over arms. We will assume that all average rewards $\\mu_{ij}$ are distinct, which means that all the preferences are *strict preferences*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting, typically, the arms **know their own preferences** over players. Meaning that arm $i$ knows all the mean rewards $\\mu_{ij}, j =1\\ldots n$. However, the players **do not know their own preferences** over arms. This means that any algorithm designed to match players to arms must help players **learn their preferences**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will talk about two restrictions of this setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB): {-}\n",
    "If there is only one player and $n$ arms this problem becomes and instance of Multi-Armed Bandits. Take another look at Lab 8 to convince yourself that this is the case. In MAB problems the goal is to pick arms in a way that incurs as little Regret as possible when compared to the best arm in hindsight. Therefore, put another way, in a MAB problem the goal of the player is to learn their own preferences over arms as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stable-Matching (SM): {-}\n",
    "In multi-player settings, if each player knew their preferences, then, this becomes an instance of a Stable Matching problem. To see this connection with the SM example from lecture, imagine that the players are the *drummers* and the arms are the *bands*. The goal is to find a Matching between players and arms such that there are no blocking pairs.\n"
